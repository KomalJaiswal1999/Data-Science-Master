    "1.Descriptive Statistics :- In the descriptive Statistics, the Data is described in a summarized way. The summarization is done from the sample of the population using different parameters like Mean or standard deviation. Descriptive Statistics are a way of using charts, graphs, and summary measures to organize, represent, and explain a set of Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is typically arranged and displayed in tables or graphs summarizing details such as histograms, pie charts, bars or scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive Statistics are just descriptive and thus do not require normalization beyond the Data collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE :- A student's grade point average (GPA), for example, provides a good understanding of descriptive statistics. The idea of a GPA is that it takes data points from a wide range of exams, classes, and grades, and averages them together to provide a general understanding of a student's overall academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inferential Statistics :- In the Inferential Statistics, we try to interpret the Meaning of descriptive Statistics. After the Data has been collected, analyzed, and summarised we use Inferential Statistics to describe the Meaning of the collected Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics use the probability principle to assess whether trends contained in the research sample can be generalized to the larger population from which the sample originally comes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics are intended to test hypotheses and investigate relationships between variables and can be used to make population predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inferential Statistics are used to draw conclusions and inferences, i.e., to make valid generalizations from samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "EXAMPLE:- Mr. A wants to open a coffee shop in New York, USA. To design the appropriate menu, a survey is conducted on 300 residents with the aim of understanding their tastes and preferences. The survey includes people of different age groups, gender, and income class. After applying the tools of inferential statistics."

    "#### There are Two type of Data\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Categorical Data (Qualitative Data):- \n",
    "Categorical data represents characteristics. It is also called qualitative data, which means you cannot express it as a numerical value. Therefore, you cannot measure it. It involves variables such as words, symbols, pictures, which help you sort information based on a category—for example, holiday destinations, gender, language, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The categorical data has the following two categories of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### (a) Nominal Data:\n",
    "Nominal type of data involves variables that do not have any natural order. It is also known as nominal scale. It helps you in labeling variables without providing the numerical value. You cannot order or measure nominal data sets. Furthermore, you cannot perform any arithmetic operation on nominal variables like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: 1.Color of a person's hair, like blonde, brown, black, burgundy, etc., cannot be compared with one another to derive any meaningful information about it. You cannot conclude that blonde is greater or less than brown. \n",
    "\n",
    "###### (b) Ordinal Data :\n",
    "Ordinal means something that is in order. The ordinal type of data involves variables that follow a natural order. Ordinal variables are placed in order by their position (for example, first, second, third, etc.). As the ordinal data variables only represent a sequence, you cannot perform any arithmetic operation on these variables like addition, subtraction, division, multiplications, etc. It is primarily found in surveys, questionnaires, finance, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:-\n",
    "1.Class ranking in a school: 8th, 9th, 10th, and so on \n",
    "\n",
    "2.Time of the day: morning, afternoon, dawn, evening, night, and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Numerical Data (Quantitative Data) :-\n",
    "It is one of the simplest data types to understand. As the name says, it represents a numerical value and helps answer questions like how many, how much, how long, etc. Example, 1.The number of apples 2.The number of students in a class 3.The height/weight of a person\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the data sets, the quantitative data is further classified into the two following categories of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "###### (a) Discrete Data :\n",
    "Discrete type of data involves only integers or discrete values. It contains a finite number of values that cannot be subdivided into smaller parts. It takes into account only those items that you cannot measure but only count.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "Number of boats on a port Number of employees in an organization You can use a bar chart to display discrete types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### (b) Continuous Data :\n",
    "Continuous type of data is the data that you can measure. It contains an infinite number of values that can be subdivided into smaller parts. It takes into account only those items that you cannot count but only measure. It can take any value between two numbers like 45.7, 23.8, 10.4, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "Length of pages of a book Time taken by athletes to finish a race The weight of students in a class It is further divided into the following categories of data: 3. Interval Data Interval data values have meaningful distances between the measurements defined. It is a data type that is measured along a scale, in which each point is placed at an equal distance from one another. It involves variables containing numerical values that you can order and calculate the exact difference between them. For example, temperature, dates, time-interval (4 am, 4 pm), etc. 4. Ratio Data Ratio data is identical to interval data, except it does have an absolute zero. It is also an ordered data unit that can only be measured and ordered with equidistant items. Unlike interval data, these values can never be negative. For example, age, height, or weight of a person. Age, height, or weight can be measured but can never be a negative value."
