    "Consider a computer system with a single processor. If it is assigned several processes at the same time, it will have to interrupt each task and switch briefly to another, to keep all of the processes going.This situation is just like a chef working in a kitchen alone. He has to do several tasks like baking, stirring, kneading dough, etc.\n",
